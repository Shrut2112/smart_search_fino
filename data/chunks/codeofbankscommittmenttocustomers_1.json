It provides protection to customers and \nexplains how bank is expected to deal with customers in their day-to-day operations. The code \ncontains practices and commitments as prescribed in Code of Bank’s Commitment to \nCustomers as issued by Banking Codes and Standards Boards of India. The Code does not replace or supersede regulatory or supervisory instructions of the Reserve \nBank of India (RBI) and we will comply with such instructions/directions issued by RBI from time \nto time. Provisions of the Code may have set higher standards than those prescribed in the \nregulatory instructions and such higher standards will prevail as the Code represents best \npractices voluntarily agreed to by us as our commitment to you. We will endeavor to adopt higher standards of banking practices to extend better customer \nservice and achieve higher levels of customer satisfaction. In the Code, ‘you’ denotes the \ncustomer and ‘we’ / ‘us’, the bank, the customer deals with. .",
