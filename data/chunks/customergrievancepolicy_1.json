Policy Content \n.1 Introduction In the present scenario of competitive banking, excellence in customer service is the most \nimportant tool for sustained business growth. Customer complaints are part of the business life of \nany corporate entity. This is more so for banks because banks are service organizations. As a \nservice organization, customer service and customer satisfaction should be the prime concern of \nany bank. The bank believes that providing prompt and efficient service is essential not only to \nattract new customers, but also to retain existing ones. This policy document aims at minimizing \ninstances of customer complaints and grievances through proper service delivery and review \nmechanism and to ensure prompt redressal of customer complaints and grievances. The review \nmechanism should help in identifying shortcomings in product features and service delivery. .2 Objective The objective of the policy is to ensure that: • \nAll customers are treated respectfully, fairly and without bias at all times. • \nAll issues raised by customers are dealt with courtesy, efficiency and resolved on time.",
